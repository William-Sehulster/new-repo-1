Pentaho Configuration

-The xml job and transformation files are meant to be stored and run out of a database Kettle Database Repository
called inbound_erx_repo.  They are exported into the xml format to bring under source control.  The Spoon tool
is used to import/export these xml job/transformation definition files into the Kettle Database Repository.

-The Kettle Database Repository connection is defined in the configuration\repositories.xml file.  This should be modified 
for each environment leaving the name as inbound_erx_repo.  The repository.xml is normally located in the .kettle directory
of the PDI software owner account.

-The Carte configuration\*_server_config.xml files define the master slave and slave servers for the Carte clusters.  These should be
modified for each environment.
