Running Fortify scan using Fortify Maven plugin

Prerequisites - Maven 3.3.x installed, M2_HOME is set, mvn is on Windows Path, and HP Fortify SCA installed to C:\Fortify\Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_19.2.3. Note: Check SwA Wiki to make sure you are using the latest approved version of Fortify SCA.

The latest software can be downloaded here if you have already obtained a license file:

1) Install Fortify into C:\Fortify and install Fortify Maven Plugin into your local maven repo. 

To install Maven Plugin from Windows Explorer:
"cd" to this directory:  C:\Fortify\Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_19.2.3\plugins\maven\

extract maven-plugin-bin.zip to maven-plugin-bin

Run:
C:\Fortify\Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_19.2.3\plugins\maven\maven-plugin-bin\install.bat


2) before each scan it's a good idea to check for a new Rule Pack. 
   cd to C:\Fortify\Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_19.2.3\bin and run fortifyupdate.cmd  This updates the Fortify rulepacks
3) Now any maven project can be scanned either inside Eclipse or by lauching the following commands from the directory containing
   the parent POM.xml for the project. For to scan the entire Inbound project launch, run commands below from here:
   C:\{project_root}\PS_INB_ERX_Fortify

set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip="true"
mvn -Dfortify.sca.buildId=Inbound com.fortify.sca.plugins.maven:sca-maven-plugin:clean
mvn -Dfortify.sca.buildId=Inbound package -Dmaven.test.skip="true"  -Dfortify.sca.source=1.8 com.fortify.sca.plugins.maven:sca-maven-plugin:translate
mvn -Dfortify.sca.buildId=Inbound -Dfortify.sca.source=1.8  com.fortify.sca.plugins.maven:sca-maven-plugin:scan 


4)  ZIP file assembly for SwA source code submission with FPRs and possible README files

Zip Method using 7-ZIP:

1) cd to the directory containing the @filelist.txt file 
2) run >C:\Data\7-Zip\7z a -tzip archive.zip @filelist.txt -spf
3) Note: A file list based on the FPR sources scanned from each FPR exists.  The list of files (filelist.txt) is passed into 7zip and used a 7zip command to zip (above).
If additional packages/classes are added to projects, verify that this file list captures all scanned code. The zipped file count
must match the files scanned count from the FPR project overview window.
4) After the 7-zip procedure above, the zip file must be opened using 7zip File Manager, copied to the file system and then re-zipped into a Windows compressed folder.
This step allows the zip/compressed folder to be opened in Windows.
